From  what  I've  seen  with  editors  other  than  Eric,  the  elephant  in  the  room  is  the  issue  of  baiting/poking  the  bear/whatever  the  hell  you  want  to  call  passive/aggressive  baiting.  No  one  wants  to  touch  that  one,  even  though  it's  uncivil  as  hell  and  appears  to  be  the  tactic  of  choice  whenever  someone  wants  to  get  rid  of  someone  or  get  their  way.

Notability  of  Rurika  Kasuga 
A  tag  has  been  placed  on  Rurika  Kasuga,  requesting  that  it  be  speedily  deleted  from  Wikipedia.  This  has  been  done  because  the  article  seems  to  be  about  a  person,  group  of  people,  band,  club,  company,  or  web  content,  but  it  does  not  indicate  how  or  why  the  subject  is  notable,  that  is,  why  an  article  about  that  subject  should  be  included  in  Wikipedia.  Under  the  criteria  for  speedy  deletion,  articles  that  do  not  assert  notability  may  be  deleted  at  any  time.  Please  see  the  guidelines  for  what  is  generally  accepted  as  notable,  and  if  you  can  indicate  why  the  subject  of  this  article  is  notable,  you  may  contest  the  tagging.  To  do  this,  add    on  the  top  of  the  page  (below  the  existing  db  tag)  and  leave  a  note  on  the  article's  talk  page  explaining  your  position.  Please  do  not  remove  the  speedy  deletion  tag  yourself,  but  don't  hesitate  to  add  information  to  the  article  that  would  confirm  its  subject's  notability  under  the  guidelines.

  Socialistm?   
 
There  are  two  important  features  of  Smith's  concept  of  the  ""invisible  hand"".  First,  Smith  was  not  advocating  a  social  policy  (that  people  should  act  in  their  own  self  interest),  but  rather  was  describing  an  observed  economic  reality  (that  people  do  act  in  their  own  interest).  Second,  Smith  was  not  claiming  that  all  self-interest  has  beneficial  effects  on  the  community.  He  did  not  argue  that  self-interest  is  always  good;  he  merely  argued  against  the  view  that  self-interest  is  necessarily  bad.  It  is  worth  noting  that,  upon  his  death,  Smith  left  much  of  his  personal  wealth  to  charity.

As  for  your  claims  of  ""stalking"",  that  is  absolute  rubbish  and  serves  only  to  aggravate  the  situation.

Not  at  all,  you  are  making  a  straw  man  argument  here.  I  never  claimed  O'Donohue  had  that  position,  rather  that  practitioners  and  researchers  in  the  field  ignored  the  DSM  position,  which  is  exactly  what  the  quote  says  and  also  something  O'Donohue  agrees  with.   
 
Again,  I  was  combating  the  notion  that  it  was  a  ""absurd  part""  to  claim  that  pedophilia  is  a  sexual  orientation.  Since  many  researchers  hold  this  position,  it  would  be  unfair  to  call  it  absurd.  The  disorder  part  is  divided  in  the  field,  some  argue  that  it  is  not  a  disorder  at  all,  some  do.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  it  is  a  value  judgment  (as  Cantor  pointed  out  earlier  in  the  thread),  not  a  scientific  judgement.  If  we  choose  to  make  this  value  judgment  in  the  article,  it  should  be  stated  clearly  and  not  pretend  to  have  a  scientific  basis.      " __label__0

  ""Mainland  Asia""  includes  ""the  lower  basin  of  China's  Yangtze  River""  as  well  as  ""Korea"".    But  being  specific  is  fine  too.    I  just  found  a  citation  for  a  more  comprehensive  DNA  study  by  Hammer  below,  rather  than  our  generarizations  and  speculation  so  far.   
 
  Citation  for  ""Yayoi  culture  was  brought  to  Japan  by  migrants  from  Korea,  who  in  turn  trace  their  roots  to  southeast  Asia/south  China.""   
 
  2005  DNA  study  by  Hammer 
  Describes  the  Yayoi  migration  from  Korea  based  on  the  O-SRY(465)  genes  and  other  genes  with  close  lineage  (haplogroups  O-M122  and  O-M95). 
Reiterates  that  ""the  entire  O  haplogroup  has  been  proposed  to  have  a  Southeast  Asian  origin.""    (Their  definition  of  Southeast  Asia  includes  southern  China).    Then  hypothesizes  that  ""the  dispersals  of  Neolithic  farmers  from  Southeast  Asia  also  brought  haplogroup  O  lineages  to  Korea  and  eventually  to  Japan."" 
  In  the  concluding  paragraph,  it  states  ""we  propose  that  the  Yayoi  Y  chromosomes  descend  from  prehistoric  farmers  that  had  their  origins  in  southeastern  Asia,  perhaps  going  back  to  the  origin  of  agriculture  in  this  region."" 
  Hammer's  DNA  study  is  based  on  a  ""global  sample  consisted  of  >  2,500  males  from  39  Asian  populations,  including  six  populations  sampled  from  across  the  Japanese  archipelago.""

Of  course  it  can.  The  word  ""Irish""  wasn't  invented  on  the  establishment  of  the  Irish  Free  State.  Talk   
 
Quote  me  all  you  want,  it  depends  on  the  context  of  the  term  when  its  being  used  as  to  whether  its  applicable  or  not.  Note  how  i  said  citizenship  and  ethnicity  -  i  never  mentioned  nationality  which  is  the  real  key  meaning.  The  nationality  meaning  of  the  term  is  the  predominantly  used  form  on  Wikipedia.  In  nationality  terms  it  refers  to  the  Republic  of  Ireland.

BI,  you  said  you  wanted  to  talk 
 
At  the  bottom  of  the  lead  section  you  have  written: 
 
""Its  promoter  speculated  in  1994  that  the  skyhook  concept  could  be  cost  competitive  with  what  is  realistically  thought  to  be  achievable  using  a  space  elevator,  but  the  skyhook  is  not  competitive  with  other  rotating  tether  concepts.  In  addition,  the  rotating  skyhook  is  in  fact  deemed  ""not  engineeringly  feasible  using  presently  available  materials""."" 
 
Regarding:    In  addition,  the  rotating  skyhook  is  in  fact  deemed  ""not  engineeringly  feasible  using  presently  available  materials"" 
 
That  statement  appears  to  come  from  Ref  [3]  on  page  10.    The  full  quote  is 
 
""If  the  mass  of  the  tether  alone  started  to  exceed  200  times  the  mass  of  the  payload, 
then  that  was  an  indication  the  particular  scenario  being  considered  was  not  engineeringly 
feasible  using  presently  available  materials,  although  the  application  might  become  feasible  in 
the  near  future  as  better  materials  become  available  with  higher  tensile  strengths  at  higher 
operational  temperatures."" 
 
It  then  goes  on  to  say 
 
""As  we  shall  see,  presently  available  commercial  materials  will  suffice  to  make  the  HASTOL 
tethers  needed.  The  primary  message  we  want  to  leave  with  the  Reader  is: 
“We  don't  need  magic  materials  like  ‘Buckminster-Fuller-carbon-nanotubes’  to  make 
the  space  tether  facility  for  a  HASTOL  system.  Existing  materials  will  do.”"" 
 
So  it  would  appear  that  you  misread  your  reference.    The  tether  mass  of  200  times  mass  of  the  payload  mass  is  the  upper  limit  to  the  problem.    Systems  where  the  tether  mass  is  less  than  200  times  the  payload  mass  can  be  built  with  ""presently  available  commercial  materials."" 
 
To  further  reinforce  this  the  Conclusion  to  the  report  states 
 
""The  fundamental  conclusion  of  the  Phase  I  HASTOL  study  effort  is  that  the  concept  is 
technically  feasible.  We  have  evaluated  a  number  of  alternate  system  configurations  that  will 
allow  hypersonic  air-breathing  vehicle  technologies  to  be  combined  with  orbiting,  spinning  space 
tether  technologies  to  provide  a  method  of  moving  payloads  from  the  surface  of  the  Earth  into 
Earth  orbit.  For  more  than  one  HASTOL  architecture  concept,  we  have  developed  a  design 
solution  using  existing,  or  near-term  technologies.  We  expect  that  a  number  of  the  other 
HASTOL  architecture  concepts  will  prove  similarly  technically  feasible  when  subjected  to 
detailed  design  studies.  The  systems  are  completely  reusable  and  have  the  potential  of  drastically 
reducing  the  cost  of  Earth-to-orbit  space  access."" 
 
Regarding:  ""but  the  skyhook  is  not  competitive  with  other  rotating  tether  concepts.""  and   
 
""A  2000  Boeing  report  on  the  possibillity  of  combining  skyhooks  with  hypersonic  planes  concluded  that  ""In  general,  the  non-spinning  tether  HyperSkyhook  concept  does  not  look  competitive  with  the  spinning  tether  concepts.""."" 
 
The  full  quote  is: 
 
""HyperSkyhook

Transliteration  of  Russian  place  names 
In  writing  about  Moscow  Metro  for  the  Malayalam  Wikipedia,  we  are  finding  it  difficult  to  correctly  transliterate  the  Russian  place  names.  For  example,  do  we  pronounce  Park  Kultury  as  PAARK  KALTTARI  or  PAARK  KALCHCHARI  (or  perhaps  something  completely  different)?  Can  somebody  please  help  by  transliterating  the  list  given  in  https://ml.wikipedia.org/wiki/സംവാദം:മോസ്കോ_മെട്രോ.

I  don't  believe  the  Lisak  criticism  present  there  conforms  with  the  NPV  rule.    Lisak  doesn't  have  a  neutral  point  of  view  to  begin  with.

If  you  know  you  are  telling  the  truth,  you  will  argue  with  machine  or  investigator.

Arguing  that  Lisak  is  a  respected  PHD  is  baseless  if  Kanin  is  a  respected  PHD.    I  agree  that  my  edit  wasn't  as  neutral  as  possible  though,  so  apologize  for  that.    Still  something  must  be  done  here. __label__0

"==  Attributing  and  classifying  of  personalities  ==   
Invitation.  Your  input  to  Culture  of  Lithuania  is  welcomed.   
Some  problems  of  defining  personalities  or  attributing  them  to  certain  well-known  ideological  systems  may  raise  here.  I  propose  a  quite  liberal  variant  of  it,  where  definition  may  not  be  connected  with  one  certain  word.  Necessity  however  to  follow  certain  classifying  remains.   
 
My  initial  ideas  on  this  branch,  the  ones,  concerning  period  of  Lithuanian  national  Renaissance  period:  Some  artists,  writers  or  other  cultural  workers  of  this  period  are  often  described  as    modernists.  This  definition  is  not  false,  but  some  more  concrete  things  should  be  added,  some  specifics  of  Lithuania.   
We  should  distinguish  leading  ideas  of  the  Nat.  Renaissance  from  later  modernism,  which  is  more  known  for  us.  Cultural  aspirations  of  the  later  Nat.  Ren.  may  be  defined  as    modernism  in  a  cultural  context  of  Lithuania.  But  they  accented  also  expression  of  Lithuanian  cultural  heritage,  and  their  expression  may  be  seen  as  something  simply  typically    Lithuanian.  I  mean,  that  such  authors  in  as    Čiurlionis  is  seen  as  modernist  in  Lithuanian  context,  but  it  also  (and  even  more)  is  a  representative  of  Lithuanian  culture,  when  in  European  or  World-wide  context.  A  parallel    example  may  be  taken  from  literature  of  India.  Poet    Tagore,  well  known  Nobel  price  winner  is  known  for  us  as  a  representative  of  culture  of  India.  Making  India  more  understandable  and  closer  for  western  people  is  concerned  as  main  his  input  to  Western  culture.  But  in  his  own  country,  he  was  seen  as  a  modernist  too,  who  was  changing  traditional  cultural  forms,  especially  stagnated  ones.  This  way  also  Lithuanian  cultural  leaders  of  the  N.  Ren.  could  be  seen  as  modernists,  which  were  broadening  cultural  forms  and  changing  stagnated  ones,  in  Lithuanian  context.  They  also  can  be  seen  as  modernists  in  a  wider  context,  but  more  for  acquainting  Western  people  with  Lithuanian  culture  than  for  their  direct  input  into  Western  culture.  Čiurlionis  is  the  best  example  here.   
In  other  way,  the  later  Lithuanian  modernists  (they  depended  mostly  to  later    generation,  approximately  from  4th  decade  of  the  20th  century)  concerned  themselves  part  of  Western  modernistic  movement  and  their  main  purpose  (looking  generally)  was    to  introduce  Western  European  ideas  into  Lithuanian  cultural  life  (see  the  table  below).   
We  see  two  different  movements  and  two  different  world  outlooks  here.  The  problem  is,  that  both  movements  collaborated,  especially  their  political  wings  did,  and  interchange  of  ideas  between  them  is  well  seen.  So,  many  researchers  don't  pay  attention  to  this  difference.  Especially  in  the  Soviet  period,  when  national  ideas  were  officially  forbidden,  mixture  in  description  of  these  movements  was  allowed.  E.  g.  philosopher  Ramūnas  Bytautas,  who  clearly  depends  to  the  first  generation,  is  often  described  as  liberal.  And  it  may  be  understood  in  a  sense  of  the  second  generation  (as  idea  of  liberalism). 
   
 
  period  and  generation    artists,  writers,  philosophers  etc  in  a  context  of  Lithuania  in  an  European  context  The  National  Renaissance  period,  the  younger  generation,  approx  1905  –  1930    painter  and  composer    Čiurlionis,  painter  Kazys  Šimonis,  poet  and  philosopher  Vilius  Storastas  -  Vydūnas,  dramatist  Sofija  Kymantaitė  -  Čiurlionienė,  poets  Adomas  Jakštas,  Motiejus  Gustaitis,  Liudas  Gira,  composer  Stasys  Šimkus,  philosopher  Ramūnas  Bytautas.    reformers  and  innovators  of  Lithuanian  culture  Representatives  of  Lithuanian  culture,  almost  unknown  before  them.

I  tend  to  think  that  when  the  list  is  longer  than  the  rest  of  the  article,  there's  a  problem.    Either  the  history  and  characteristics  should  be  expanded,  of  the  list  should  be  culled.    I  personally  like  the  consensus  that  was  reached  in  the  Tripel  article  between    and  others...myself  included.    We  decided  that  the  country  of  origin  should  be  highlighted  with  the  most  examples.    There  we  did  Trappist,  Abbey,  and  Foreign.    Foreign  includes  all  non-Belgium  examples.    This  way  the  article  is  an  article  in  an  encyclopedia,  not  a  list.    People  can  find  lists  anywhere,  and  the  article  should  reference  this.    Also,  the  style  statistics  are  bad.    When  you  say  style  statistics,  it  sounds  like  a  prescription,  not  a  description.    An  encyclopedia  should  follow  the  latter,  and  if  the  former  is  used,  a  citation  should  follow...And  you'll  not  find  a  valid  one  for  this  style  in  it's  country  of  origin. __label__0

Before  you  start  throwing  accusations  and  warnings  at  me,  lets  review  the  edit  itself-making  ad  hominem  attacks  isn't  going  to  strengthen  your  argument,  it  will  merely  make  it  look  like  you  are  abusing  your  power  as  an  admin.   
Now,  the  edit  itself  is  relevant-this  is  probably  the  single  most  talked  about  event  int  he  news  as  of  late.  His  absence  is  notable,  since  he  is  the  only  living  ex-president  who  did  not  attend.  That's  certainly  more  notable  than  his  dedicating  an  aircracft  carrier.   
I  intend  to  revert  this  edit,  in  hopes  of  attracting  the  attention  of  an  admin  that  is  willing  to  look  at  the  issue  itself,  and  not  throw  accusations  around  quite  so  liberally.  Perhaps,  if  you  achieve  a  level  of  civility  where  you  can  do  this,  we  can  have  a  rational  discussion  on  the  topic  and  resolve  the  matter  peacefully. __label__0

I  was  able  to  post  the  above  list  so  quickly  because  I  already  had  it  in  a  text  file  in  my  hard  drive    I've  been  meaning  to  get  around  to  updating  the  sound  list  for  some  time  now.   
As  far  as  generating  interest    I've  spent  four  years  trying  to  drum  up  more  interest  in  freely  licensed  full  length  classical  music.  Unfortunately,  my  attempts  failed  -  I'm  still  effectively  the  only  one  who  does  it.  The  classical  music  wikiproject  was  not  interested,  (Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Classical_music/Archive_5#Need_help.21Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Music/Archive_3#I_could_use_some_helpWikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Music/Archive_2#Raulbot.2C_and_the_music_list)  So  I  really  had  given  up  trying  to  interest  others.     
The  sound  list  was  featured  on  digg  a  while  back  -  http://digg.com/music/Wikipedia_has_free_classical_music_downloads  .  It  got  1600  diggs,  which  is  IMO  very  impressive. __label__0

Well,  after  I  asked  you  to  provide  the  diffs  within  one  hour  of  your  next  edit  here,  you  made  an  edit  to  your  talk  page  here  and  then  did  not  provide  the  diffs  I  requested  within  one  hour  of  that  edit.  I  then  sanctioned  you  for  failing  to  provide  the  requested  diffs  in  a  timely  manner  (which,  after  more  than  a  week,  you  have  still  not  done).  Consequently,  your  request  to  lift  the  sanction  is  denied.    " __label__0
LACK  OF  BALANCE 
 
This  article  is  seriously  out  of  balance.    It  would  benefit  greatly  from  the  introduction  of  additional  information  about  the  negative  aspects  of  the  T-34.    Just  for  the  record,  this  sort  of  balance  problem  is  not  uncommon  when  there  is  an  over  dependence  on  the  works  of  a  particular  author.    For  example,  testing  and  evaluation  of  a  T-34  by  the  US  Army  Ordnance  Dept.  exposed  some  very  serious  problems  with  the  tank.    This  type  of  information  should  be  included  in  the  article  to  bring  it  back  into  balance. __label__0

Are  you  being  facetious?  if  not,  you  would  have  relayed  the  same  message  to  Jza  and  MRSC  as  my  words  were  no  more  stern  than  theres.  If  you  would  like  evidence  for  any  of  the  claims  made  on  the  talk,  then  I  will  only  be  too  glad  to  provide.  You  also  failed  to  provide  diffs  in  your  message  to  me,  in  regards  to  which  words  you're  claiming  are  offesive,  perhaps  WP:Assume  good  faith. 
 
The  two  users  constantly  harass  and  follow  me  to  articles  making  disruptive  edits  in  violation  of  numerous  Wikipedia  guidelines  (WP:HARASS  is  just  one).  For  example  the  removal  of  third  party  references  from  articles  which  don't  suit  their  POV,  without  entering  an  edit  summary  (considered  by  Wikipedia  guidelines  as  bad  faith  and  a  violation  of  WP:BLANK).  The  violation  of  WP:NEO  by  adding  derogatory  neologisms  to  the  articles  of  organisations  who  they  do  not  personally  agree  with,  despite  being  made  aware  of  the  policy,  despite  not  having  any  reference  to  the  said  organisation  being  described  with  said  neologislm  and  despite  the  community  majority  constantly  removing  the  derogatory  term.    The  same  ""tag  team""  practise  can  be  shown  to  be  used  against  numerous  other  editors  who  edit  articles  on  British  culture  and  trad  counties,  not  just  against  me.  Again,  if  you  would  like  evidence  just  ask. 
 
It  would  seem  however,  looking  at  the  messages  on  your  talkpage  above,  especially  the  lovely  intertude  under  ""UK  mediation""  section,  that  Jza  messaged  you  (somebody  he  seems  very  familiar  with)  in  violation  of  WP:CANVAS.  Specifically  the  section  on  Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning  may  interest  you.  If  you're  going  to  be  an  admin,  may  I  suggest  you  please  make  yourself  familiar  with  the  policies  and  guidelines  I  have  referenced  in  this  message.  Rather  than  accusing  me,  a  user  who  is  being  cyberstalked,  of  ""personal  attacks"".  Systematic  bias  is  not  acceptable,  you're  here  to  make  sure  that  our  policies  are  upheld  not  to  chip  in  for  the  sake  of  a  friend.  Thanks.  -      " __label__0

Personal  attacks  in  Fruit  Brute  VfD   
 
My  apologies  if  I'm  being  to  critical,  but  I  feel  that  many  of  the  comments  made  in  the  Fruit  Brute  VfD  debate  were  far  from  reasonable.    There  had  to  be  a  more  diplomatic  way  to  disagree  with  's  assertion  on  the  initial  sentence  than  don't  lie,  it  makes  you  look  even  more  juvenile....  Learn  to  face  up  to  when  you've  goofed,  it  will  go  a  long  way  in  your  life    The  attacks  do  to  his  age  certainly  border  on  a  personal  attack.    Were  Bart133  forty,  sixty,  or  eighty,  would  you  have  included  the  comment  on  how  'juvenile'  he  is? 
 
I  don't  expect  you  to  apologise  to  anyone,  but  I  want  to  make  it  clear  that  I  consider  your  comments  in  this  VfD  debate  inappropriate,  and  I  think  their  are  many  members  of  the  community  who  would  agree  with  me.      talk  06:46,  2005  Feb  7  (UTC) __label__0

Paleontologists  agree  that  organic  remains  must  be  buried  quickly  so  they  can  be  preserved  long  enough  to  be  come  fossilized.    However,  the  term  fossilized  is  not  a  very  precise  term.    There  are  several  factors  and  metamorphic  mineral  processes  which  occur  to  organic  remains  that  result  in  what  is  typically  called  a  fossil.    One  major  factor  concerns  what  kind  of  organisms  are  to  be  fossilized    vertebrate,  invertebrates,  radiolarians,  sponges,  plants,  pollen,  foot  prints,  etc.    And  multiple  processes  may  include  permineralization,  recrystalization,  carbonization,  replacement,  dissolving,  diagenesis,  etc.    Talking  about  fossilization  is  a  complex  issue,  however  quick  burial  is  not  questioned. 
 
The  major  question  is,  how  long  does  it  take  for  these  processes  to  work  on  organic  reamins  in  the  environment  they  are  found  in?    Experimental  taphonomy  has  resulted  in  an  assortment  of  remains  becoming  fossilized  by  various  processes  in  the  lab,  which  of  course  implies  that  given  the  right  conditions,  vast  ages  are  not  an  issue.    The  metamorphic  processes  are  ongoing  until  an  equilibrium  is  met  between  the  chemical  enviroument  of  the  burial  site  and  the  minerals  of  the  organic  remains.    Flood  catastrophic  geologists  do  not  expect  that  organic  remains  buried  during  the  flood  were  completely  fossilized  within  the  one  year  period  of  the  flood,  but  rather  that  there  has  been  some  4000  years  for  the  processes  to  have  been  working.    Much  more  work  needs  to  be  done  on  the  taphonomy  of  organic  remains.    Yet,  how  one  interprets  even  those  results  will  depend  upon  which  world  view  you  choose  to  believe  with. __label__0
Hi

My  deepest  apologies  that  I  had  made  the  change. 
I  had  made  the  change  it  was  because  I  was  there.  On  the  day.

when  the  clock  strikes  12  exactly  at  the  noon  on  that  day.  (The  date  which  I  provided). 
It  was  the  most  beautiful  thing  I  ever  see. 
I  know  many  thing  need  prove  but  I  know  what  I  saw  that  day.  It  is  up  to  you  now 
but  it  was  okay  if  black  and  white  prove  to  be  needed.  I  don't  have  any. 
My  sincere  apologies  for  the  trouble  I  had  cause  you.

=  My  Famous  Article  ==witze    happiness  −  wikipedia  The  Witzeman  is  a  great  honour  that  has  been  passed  down  through  the  generations  of  many  families,  regardless  of  race,  age,  character  or  knowledge.  The  outside  world  knows  little  about  these  elusive  characters,  and  the  honour  of  the  Witzeman.  For  those  who  have  ever  been  a  Witzeman,  it  has  been  said  to  have  been  a  great  honour,  although  the  qualities  needed  for  the  job  have  never  been  disclosed.  A  person  may  not  now  they  were  a  Witzeman  for  many  years,  until  they  are  called  by  former  Witzemans  via  dreams.  Associates  of  the  Witzeman  are  known  to  be  a  certain  Babe  Cool  or  the  much  lesser  known  Witzewoman. 
 
The  Present  Witzeman  is  an  11-year-old  boy  namely  Benjamin  Woods,  who  is  said  to  have  become  a  Witzeman  after  he  felt  this  'awesome  radiance  in  his  top-right  bumcheek'.  He  has  not  told  a  great  number  of  people  his  testimony,  but  has  promised  to  do  so  in  years  to  come. 
 
                                                      History 
The  present  world  has  only  come  enlightned  with  the  knowledge  of  the  Witzeman  in  present  years,  because  former  Witzemen  have  not  been  so  public  about  the  honour,  to  abide  with  the  formality  and  conservativism  in  their  time.  The  term  'Witzeman'  is  a  compound  word  of  the  adjective  Witze  and  'man',  witze  being  an  11th  century  term  for  'a  person  of  extreme  humour  and  radiant  intelligence'.  Unfortuneatly,  Witze  is  also  sometimes  associated  with  bad  wind,  for  unspeakable  reasons. 
 
                                              Proper  History 
As  early  as  the  14th  century,  Witzemen  were  considered  outcasts,  and  young  children  were  encouraged  to  poke  them  with  sticks.  This  led  to  the  1st  Witzeman  Rebellion  of  1555  when  the  current  Witzeman  and  his  followers  attempted  a  coup  to  take  over  the  local  Council  chess  team.  This  rebellion  further  disgraced  the  Witzeman,  as  he  and  his  followers  were  embarassingly  pronounced  'gaga'  at  a  Government  meeting  that  year.  The  period  from  here  to  the  early  1900s  was  a  dark  time  in  the  Witzemans  history.  However  good  times  were  to  come  for  the  Witzeman.  Many  normal  people  took  part  in  mass  demonstrations  and  protests  for  the  Witzeman  in  the  1980s,  building  up  to  a  great  moment  in  the  history...the  Great  Rebellion  of  1988.  This  was  when  several  Witzeman  sprinted  round  the  Visitors  Gallery  of  the  House  of  Commons,  wearing  clown  masks,  but  otherwise  completely  naked.  This  was  thought  to  be  an  act  of  circambulation.  However  many  people  who  witnessed  this  shocking  behaviour,  were  'mentally,  spiritually,  and  emotionallly  scarred  for  life'.  This  group  of  people  included  many  young  children  who  were  forced  to  go  to  asylums  in  a  state  of  mental  instability,  suffering  from  trauma.  It  was  at  this  time  that  the  Government  finally  took  positive  action  for  the  Witzeman.  In  1990,  a  bill  of  rights  for  the  Witzeman  was  signed,  stating  all  Witzemen  were  allowed  to  do  as  they  pleased.  Although  this  was  a  formal  agreement,  many  journalists  viewed  it  as  a  letter  of  submission  from  the  Government  to  the  Witzeman,  as  the  behaviour  of  the  Witzeman  and  his  followers  became  more  and  more  twisted. __label__0

Yep.  LOL,  the  [[Reformist  Party  (Serbia)|Reformist  Party]  is  having  another  go  (the  20th  very  last  on  the  parliamentary  election,  winning  less  votes  than  notable  to  actually  be  mentioned).  )   
By  the  way,  here's  something  very  little  people  have  figured  out  -  the  new  Constitution  of  Serbia  has  been  brought  to  enable  Kosovo'  secession.  The  1990  Constitution  barred  that  as  a  possibility,  and  after  the  Kumanovo  Military-Technical  Agreement  was  signed  between  NATO  and  FRY  the  SRS  broke  its  coalition  with  SPS  and  the  government  collapsed,  causing  new  elections  -  because  that  was  unconstitutional,  as  an  act  of  highest  treason,  enough  to  be  tried  from  maximum  sentence  (which  the  Radicals  demanded  from  then  to  his  death,  to  have  a  trial  in  Serbia,  and  to  be  tried  for  treason  among  other  reasons).  This  constitution  releases  the  authorities  from  that  weight,  and  they  won't  have  to  go  to  prison  if  they  recognize  any  form  of  further  loss  of  sovereignty  in  Kosovo.  ;)      15 __label__0
A  Bisexual,  like  a  homosexual  or  a  heterosexual,  is  not  defined  by  sexual  activity.  (Much  like  a  15  year  old  boy  who  is  attracted  to  a  girl  sexually  but  has  never  had  sex  is  still  straight).  A  person  who  is  actually  sexually  attracted/aroused  by  the  same  sex  as  well  as  the  opposite  sex  is  bisexual. __label__0

"::::Jmabel;  in  regards  to  predominant  scholary  consensus  who  is  it  that  allegedly  claims  ""despite  ""Third  Way""  rhetoric,  fascism  in  power  functioned  rather  consistently  as  a  right-wing  force""?  As  far  as  I'm  aware  (owning  numerous  books  on  the  subject)  that  is  not  the  scholary  consensus  at  all.  The  consensus,  developed  by  respected  scholars  of  fascism  who  write  in  a  manner  which  is  not  bias  to  any  interest  group  such  as  Roger  Griffin,  Hamish  McDonald,  Roger  Eatwell  and  Zeev  Sternhell  all  recongise  fascism  as  a  ""Third  Way""  as  the  references  show. 
 
The  only  dissenters  I'm  aware  of  who  seem  to  think  fascism  has  absoutely  no  leftist  connections  and  is  merely  a  radical  right  system  are  street  level  socialists  who  want  to  put  as  much  distance  between  the  movements  as  possible.  This  of  course  does  not  come  from  educated  people  in  a  position  to  write  books.  For  example,  even  the  foremost  scholary  expert  on  Fascism,  and  a  former  member  of  both  the  Communist  Party  and  then  Socialist  Party  of  Italy,  Renzo  De  Felice  doesn't  try  to  ""cover  up""  its  socialistic  origins  and  third  way  status.  This  is  a  man  who  has  wrote  a  definitive  seven  volume  piece  on  Mussolini.  -

Juelz  Santanas  Age 
 
In  2002,  Juelz  Santana  was  18  years  old,  then  came  February  18th,  which  makes  Juelz  turn  19  making  songs  with  The  Diplomats.  The  third  neff  to  be  signed  to  Cam's  label  under  Roc  A  Fella.  In  2003,  he  was  20  years  old  coming  out  with  his  own  singles  ""Santana's  Town""  and  ""Down"".  So  yes,  he  is  born  in  1983.  He  really  is,  how  could  he  be  older  then  Lloyd  Banks?  And  how  could  he  be  22  when  his  birthday  passed?  The  homie  neff  is  23  years  old.  1983  -  2006  (Juelz  death,  god  forbid  if  your  thinking  about  that)  equals  23.  Go  to  your  caculator  and  stop  changing  his  year  of  birth.  My  god." __label__0
Yes,  because  the  mother  of  the  child  in  the  case  against  Michael  Jackson  was  studied  in  here  motives  and  reasonings  and  judged  upon  her  character  just  as  harshly  as  Wacko  Jacko  himself.    Don't  tell  me  to  ignore  it  and  incriminate  myself.    I  am  going  to  continue  refuting  the  bullshit  that  Jayjg  keeps  throwing  at  me.      18:01,  16  Jun  2005  (UTC) __label__0
